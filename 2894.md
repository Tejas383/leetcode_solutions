Problem: 
    We need to find (num1 - num2),
    where,
        num1 = sum of numbers between 1 and n, NOT divisible by m
        num2 = sum of numbers between 1 and n, divisible by m

Derivation:
    Calculating num2 ->
        numbers divisible by m -> m, 2m, 3m, ..., am
        sum = m + 2m + 3m + ... + am
            = m*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + a)
            (sum of 1st n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2)
        num2 = m*(a(a+1)/2)

        here, 
            am is the largest number divisible by m
            => am <= n
            => a <= m/n
            => a = floor(m/n)
            
            in programming, m/n gives only the integer part of the quotient
            therefore,
                a = m / n
    
    Calculating num1 ->
        num1 = sum of all numbers - num2

    Calculating sum of all numbers ->
        total = n(n+1)/2
